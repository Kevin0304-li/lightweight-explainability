- Enables quantitative evaluation of explanation quality

### Mobile Device Benchmarking
- Class `MobileDeviceBenchmark` in `mobile_benchmark.py`
- Simulates performance on Raspberry Pi, Android and iPhone devices
- Measures execution time, memory usage and speedup factors

### Custom 4-Class Dataset
- Class `CustomFourClassDataset` in `custom_dataset.py`
- Creates a balanced dataset with 4 distinct categories (animal, vehicle, furniture, food)
- Generates 100 examples with class labels for testing

### CIFAR-10 Benchmarking
- Full evaluation in `benchmark_cifar10.py`
- Tests performance on standard computer vision benchmark
- Measures accuracy, speed and memory efficiency

### User Study Framework
- Class `UserStudy` in `user_study.py`
- Simulates user interactions and feedback on explanations
- Measures user satisfaction, localization accuracy and processing time

### Audit Mode
- Functions `set_audit_mode()` and `log_audit()` in `lightweight_explainability.py`
- Records all explanations generated for compliance and review
- Saves timestamped logs with model predictions and explanation metadata
